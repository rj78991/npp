## Reference Parallelized Implementation One-Pass Computation of Statistical Moments 

A reference impplementation of SAND2018-6212 (see docs) for Robust, One-Pass Parallel Computation of Covariances and Arbitrary Order Statistical Moments.
The computations are implemented using the Intel C++ multicore library, Threading Building Blocks. The calculation interface is exposed via a python binding to the C++ code.
